# cat_in_hat
There are 100 cats in a row all wearing hats. 🐱
MEOW

Make 100 passes over the cats.

On the first pass, visit every cat and remove its hat. 🙀
MEOW

On the second pass, visit every other cat and replace its hat. 😺
MEOW

On the third pass, visit every third cat. If the cat is hatted, remove its hat 😿. If the cat is un-hatted, replace its hat. 😺
MEOW

On the 4th-100th passes, do the same. Add hats if they don’t exist and remove hats if they do.
MEOW

On the 100th pass, you should only visit the 100th cat (the last cat), removing or replacing its hat appropriately.
MEOW

Write a program that outputs which cats have hats 😺 and which cats do not 😾 at the end of the 100th iteration.
